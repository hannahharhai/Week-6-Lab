# Week-6-Lab
This is a repository that we have created for the week 6 lab exercises for CMPINF0010.  

The program we have created asks for a person's name and then their age.  The output will say hello to them, and then based on whatever their age is there will be a statement printed relevant to that age.

Our software requires the latest installation of Python.
