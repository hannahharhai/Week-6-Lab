We have chosen to adopt the Contributor Covenant as our Code of Conduct. The Contributor Covenant is a widespread and well-tested Code of Conduct that covers all use cases with which we are concerned.

Please insure that you are familiar with our Code of Conduct by reading it at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/ before contributing to our software.

We appreciate contributors who value diversity, inclusion, anti-harassment and anti-bullying.

If the Code of Conduct is not followed, contributors may be first warned, and then banned if they do not correct their behavior. It more serious cases, a ban may be an immediate consequence.
